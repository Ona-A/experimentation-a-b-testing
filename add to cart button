Pseudo code for the add to cart button example in the Experimentation A/B testing course.

let session = await recharge.auth.loginShopifyAppProxy();
//This will create an object with a customerId attribute no matter what. When a customer isn't logged in the value is null

if (session.customerId != null) {
      console.log("Customer Id present");
      const customer = await recharge.customer.getCustomer(session, { include: ['metafields'] });
      if (customer.subscriptions_active_count > 0) {
        console.log('Customer has active subscription(s)');
      }
    }
//This checks for the customerId being not null. It will be null for those on the page that aren't logged into Shopify
//If the customerId has a value then it can be used to get the customer and look at the subscriptions_active_count attribute
//If that is greater than 0 the person logged in is a customer in Recharge with at least one active subscription
